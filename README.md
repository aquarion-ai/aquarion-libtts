# Aquarion AI - Text To Speech (TTS)

Experiment in creating a scalable local AI voice chat bot.

## About Aquarion AI

The goal of this project is to create an LLM-based voice chat bot / assistant, but to
built it in such a way that is can be scaled down to a single desktop app, all the way
up to a distributed multi-server, horizontally scalable system.  Also, desired is a
taking head / avatar who's mouth moves with the speech.  Lastly, it should all run
locally / offline, even in an air gapped environment.  Oh, and it should be modular
enough to support multiple alternate STT, LLM and TTS models/engines/options.
