## About

### About Aquarion AI

The goal of this project is to create an LLM-based voice chat bot / assistant, but to
built it in such a way that is can be scaled down to a single desktop app, all the way
up to a distributed multi-server, horizontally scalable system.  Also, desired is a
taking head / avatar who's mouth moves with the speech.  Lastly, it should all run
locally / offline, even in an air gapped environment.  Oh, and it should be modular
enough to support multiple alternate STT, LLM and TTS models/engines/options.

### About this Repository

The repository contains the library of Text To Speech (TTS) backend components for
Aquarion AI.

### Disclaimer

While this project is FOSS and you are welcome to use it (if it ever becomes something
usable), know that I am making this for myself. So do not expect any kind of support or
updates or maintenance or longevity.  Caveat Emptor.

## Developer Information

### Development Standards

This project follows the following standard practices:

- [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for
  commit messages.

  - If using VS Code, then the
    [Conventional Commits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits)
    extension is recommended.
  - _If committing from the terminal, use `cz c` instead of `git commit`._

- [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for versioning.

- [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) for the changelog.

### Developer Installation

1. Clone this repository.

1. Install [Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/installing_devbox/)

1. Run:

   ```console
   devbox shell
   init
   check push
   check --help
   lang --help
   ```

#### Developer Installation Details

- Devbox is a tool for creating per-project development environments using Nix.  It is
  used in this project for non-Python dev tools and bootstrapping.
- On first run, `devbox shell` will download and install all the needed system tools
  for the environment
- On the first run, `init` will download and install the base Python version, needed
  commands, hooks, etc.
- pre-commit is a tool for running certain checks and fixes on the code before commits
  and/or pushes.
- **NOTE:** No commit, push or pull request should or will be accepted unless all
  pre-commit and pre-push hooks pass.  No exceptions!
- Hatch is a tool for managing dependencies, builds, virtual environments and Python
  versions, as well as running tests, formatting, linting and typechecking.
- The `check` command calls Hatch to perform common tasks, while also making it easier
  to do so.
- `check push` runs all common tasks like pre-commit checks, type checks, formatting,
   linting, unit tests, acceptance tests, coverage checks, security checks, etc.
- On first run, `check push` will also download and install several files, etc.
- The `check` command has several sub-commands to help you while developing.  Check it
  out. :smile_cat:
- The `lang` command is used to manage localization message catalogues, i.e. translation
  files.  It's good to check it out as well.
